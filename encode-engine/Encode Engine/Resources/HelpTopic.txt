Encode Engine v1.0 Help Topic

Encode Engine is a software developed by Myproduct company 
which is willing to encode your personal files
in order to prevent them from being read. You can put your personal
files which contain security information such as password or banking
account. When you use Encode Engine, you just need to remember only
one "Encode String" which will decide how your file will be encoded.

Only one password to remember all of your account and password or
other security information is our purpose.

User Guide

1. When you run the software, you can open the main menu and
turn to the file operation, open a text file which you want to
encode or decode and put in your "Encode String" (just like a password).

2. After you encode or decode, you can save your text to the
file you have opened or choose another path to save.

3. Different "Encode String" will encode the same text into
different code. So your encoded file is safe because other person who
don't know your "Encode String" cannot decode it correctly.

4. Please remember your "Encode String" so you can decode all files
that had been encoded under this "Encode String".
